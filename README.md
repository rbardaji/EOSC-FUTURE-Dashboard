# EOSC-FUTURE-DASHBOARD

This repository contains [EMSO-ERIC's](https://emso.eu/) contribution to the [EOSC-FUTURE](https://eoscfuture.eu/) project.

The objective of this contribution is:

1. Provide data from the EMSO observatories to the Dashboard being made by the Marine group of the project. For that, the EMSO ERIC API will have to be slightly modified to provide the data with the specifications required by the Marino group.

2. Help improve the overall project data dashboard. For this reason, a fork of the ICOS repository has been made, where there is a first version of the code to create the Dashboard. The original code will remain in the EOSC-FUTURE folder. The (dashboard)[dashboard] folder contains a refactory of the original code.

3. Other contributions to be determined.
